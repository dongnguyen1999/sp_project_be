  (14, 1, 'it can help us to understand the inner works of an algorithm. we could try to implement an algorithm more efficiently. we can add new features to an algorithm or experiment with different variations of the core idea. we circumvent licensing issues (e.g., Linux vs. Unix) or platform restrictions. we want to invent new algorithms or implement algorithms no one has implemented/shared yet. we are not satisfied with the API and/or we want to integrate it more “naturally” into an existing software library', 1),
