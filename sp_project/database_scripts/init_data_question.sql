I.e., instead of formulating “rules” manually, a machine learning algorithm will learn the model for you.', true, false, 3, null, null, 'What are machine learning and data science?', null),
  (14, '', 'it can help us to understand the inner works of an algorithm. we could try to implement an algorithm more efficiently. we can add new features to an algorithm or experiment with different variations of the core idea. we circumvent licensing issues (e.g., Linux vs. Unix) or platform restrictions. we want to invent new algorithms or implement algorithms no one has implemented/shared yet. we are not satisfied with the API and/or we want to integrate it more “naturally” into an existing software library', true, false, 1, null, null, 'Why do you and other people sometimes implement machine learning algorithms from scratch?', null);
